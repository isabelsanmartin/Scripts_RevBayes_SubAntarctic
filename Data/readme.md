In this folder, the input files for the seven target species can be found. 

1) Nexus files are used to the common biogeographic model. The files cointain the molecular matrix for each individual considered in this anaylisis and the distribution matrix where the individual are located.
2) Tree files are used to infer the individual biogeographic model. Also,  reconstruct the individual BIB model. 
3) Distribution files are used to infer the individual biogeographic model and reconstruct the individual BIB model.
