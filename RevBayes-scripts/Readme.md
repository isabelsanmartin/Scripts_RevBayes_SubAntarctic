Two types of analyses can be found in this folder:

1) Common BIB model where all the species are considered. Here, three types of parameters can be inferred: carrying capacity, species-specific overall migration rate, and dispersal rate.
2) Individual BIB model where three target species are considered. Here, an ancestral reconstruction can be modelled.
